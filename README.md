# RC-Cara-Arduino-Control
This project uses an ultrasonic sensor that detects if the RC car will crash by checking the left and right, then choosing the direction that is more empty than the other.
## Features:
-Bluetooth control that sends the distance of the nearest possible crash to the mobile application that was created by MIT app inventor
-Obstacle detection using an ultrasonic sensor
-Simple, easy-to-use mobile app
## Hardware
1. Connect the Bluetooth module to the Arduino (TX, RX, and power connections).
2. Attach the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino according to the wiring diagram.
3. Power up the system.
## Software
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Arduino code in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your board.
